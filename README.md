## Data Exploration

- ### Categorical Variable Distributions
Visualizations that display the frequency and distribution of categorical variables, providing insights into how different categories affect MPG. Bar plots and count plots illustrate the relationship between categorical features (e.g., number of cylinders, origin) and fuel efficiency.

- ### Numerical Variable Distributions
Histograms and box plots for numerical features such as horsepower, weight, and model year show the distribution, central tendency, and variability of these attributes. This analysis helps in understanding how these numerical variables relate to MPG and highlights any potential skewness or outliers.

- ## Feature Engineering
Handling missing values, scaling, and transformations to enhance model performance.

- ## Modeling
  Includes various regression techniques:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Ensemble Methods

 - ## Models are evaluated using RMSE and RÂ² metrics.

## Results
Discussion on model comparison and optimal model based on performance metrics.

## Feature Importance Visualization
A graphical representation of the features that most significantly impact MPG prediction, aiding in interpretability and understanding of model decisions.
